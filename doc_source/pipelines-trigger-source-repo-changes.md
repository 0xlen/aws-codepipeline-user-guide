# Create a CloudWatch Events Rule That Starts Your AWS CodeCommit Pipeline<a name="pipelines-trigger-source-repo-changes"></a>

You can set up a rule in CloudWatch Events to start a pipeline as soon as the AWS CodeCommit source repository changes\.

**Note**  
Your pipeline runs only when something changes in the source repository and branch that you have defined\.
