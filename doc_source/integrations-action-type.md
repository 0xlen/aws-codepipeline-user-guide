## Source Action Integrations<a name="integrations-source"></a>

The following information is organized by AWS CodePipeline action type and can help you configure AWS CodePipeline to integrate with the products and services you use\.


|  |  | 
| --- |--- |
| Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\) |  [Amazon S3](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/) is storage for the Internet\. You can use Amazon S3 to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time, from anywhere on the web\. You can configure AWS CodePipeline to use a versioned Amazon S3 bucket as the source stage for your code\. You must first create the bucket and then enable versioning on it before you can create a pipeline that uses the bucket as part of a source action within a stage\. Learn more: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/integrations-action-type.html)  | 
| AWS CodeCommit |  [AWS CodeCommit](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/) is a version control service hosted by AWS that you can use to privately store and manage assets \(such as documents, source code, and binary files\) in the cloud\. You can configure AWS CodePipeline to use a branch in an AWS CodeCommit repository as the source stage for your code\. You must first create the repository and associate it with a working directory on your local machine before you can create a pipeline that uses the branch as part of a source action within a stage\. You can connect to the AWS CodeCommit repository by either creating a new pipeline or editing an existing one\.  Learn more:  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/integrations-action-type.html)  | 
| GitHub |   You can configure AWS CodePipeline to use a [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository as the source stage for your code\. You must have previously created a GitHub account and at least one GitHub repository\. You can connect to the GitHub repository by either creating a new pipeline or editing an existing one\.  AWS CodePipeline integration with GitHub Enterprise is not supported\.  The first time you add a GitHub repository to a pipeline, you will be asked to authorize AWS CodePipeline access to your repositories\. To integrate with GitHub, AWS CodePipeline uses OAuth tokens and requires the GitHub scope `repo`, which is used to read and pull artifacts from public and private repositories into a pipeline\. For more information about GitHub scopes, see the [GitHub Developer API Reference](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#scopes)\. Access for AWS CodePipeline is configured for all repositories to which that GitHub account has access; it cannot currently be configured for individual repositories\. You can revoke this access from GitHub by choosing **Settings**, choosing **Applications**, and then, under **Authorized applications**, finding AWS CodePipeline in the list of authorized applications and choosing **Revoke**\. Revoking access will immediately prevent AWS CodePipeline from accessing any GitHub repositories previously configured for access with that GitHub account\.  If you want to limit the access AWS CodePipeline has to specific set of repositories, create a GitHub account, grant that account access to only the repositories you want to integrate with AWS CodePipeline, and then use that account when configuring AWS CodePipeline to use GitHub repositories for source stages in pipelines\.

You can use an existing build project or create one in the AWS CodePipeline console\. The output of the build project can then be deployed as part of a pipeline\.  AWS CodeBuild can also be included in a pipeline as a test action, with or without a build output\.  Learn more:  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/integrations-action-type.html)  | 
| CloudBees |  You can configure AWS CodePipeline to use [CloudBees](http://www.cloudbees.com) to build or test your code in one or more actions in a pipeline\.Learn more:[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/integrations-action-type.html) | 
| Jenkins  |  You can configure AWS CodePipeline to use [Jenkins CI](https://jenkins-ci.org/) to build or test your code in one or more actions in a pipeline\. You must have previously created a Jenkins project and installed and configured the AWS CodePipeline Plugin for Jenkins for that project\. You can connect to the Jenkins project by either creating a new pipeline or editing an existing one\. Access for Jenkins is configured on a per\-project basis\. You must install the AWS CodePipeline Plugin for Jenkins on every Jenkins instance you want to use with AWS CodePipeline\. In addition, you must configure AWS CodePipeline access to the Jenkins project\. You should secure your Jenkins project by configuring it to accept HTTPS/SSL connections only\. If your Jenkins project is installed on an Amazon EC2 instance, consider providing your AWS credentials by installing the AWS CLI on each instance and configuring an AWS profile on those instances with the IAM user profile and AWS credentials you want to use for connections between AWS CodePipeline and Jenkins, rather than adding them or storing them through the Jenkins web interface\.
