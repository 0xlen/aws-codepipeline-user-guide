+ **API version: 2015\-07\-09**
+ **Latest documentation update: 2017\-06\-29**


| Change | Description | Date Changed | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Updated topics |  When you create or edit a pipeline in the console, AWS CodePipeline now creates an Amazon CloudWatch Events rule and an AWS CloudTrail trail that detects changes to your Amazon S3 source bucket and then starts your pipeline\. For information about migrating your pipeline, see [Configure Your Amazon S3 Pipelines to Use Amazon CloudWatch Events for Change Detection](trigger-S3-migration-cwe.md)\. The [Tutorial: Create a Simple Pipeline \(Amazon S3 Bucket\)](tutorials-simple-s3.md) has been updated to show how the Amazon CloudWatch Events rule and trail are created when you select an Amazon S3 source\. [Create a Pipeline in AWS CodePipeline](pipelines-create.md) and [Edit a Pipeline in AWS CodePipeline](pipelines-edit.md) have also been updated\.  For more information, see [How to Start a Pipeline Execution in AWS CodePipeline](pipelines-about-starting.md)\.  | March 22, 2018 | 
| Updated topic | AWS CodePipeline is now available in EU \(Paris\)\. The [Limits in AWS CodePipeline](limits.md) topic has been updated\. | February 21, 2018 | 
| Updated topics |  You can now use AWS CodePipeline and Amazon ECS for continuous deployment of container\-based applications\. When you create a pipeline, you can select Amazon ECS as a deployment provider\. A change to code in your source control repository triggers your pipeline to build a new Docker image, push it to your container registry, and then deploy the updated image to an Amazon ECS service\. The topics [Product and Service Integrations with AWS CodePipeline](integrations.md), [Create a Pipeline in AWS CodePipeline](pipelines-create.md), and [AWS CodePipeline Pipeline Structure Reference](reference-pipeline-structure.md) have been updated to reflect this support for Amazon ECS\.  | December 12, 2017 | 
| Updated topics |  When you create or edit a pipeline in the console, AWS CodePipeline now creates an Amazon CloudWatch Events rule that detects changes to your AWS CodeCommit repository and then automatically starts your pipeline\. For information about migrating your existing pipeline, see [Configure Your AWS CodeCommit Pipelines to Use Amazon CloudWatch Events for Change Detection](trigger-codecommit-migration-cwe.md)\. The [Tutorial: Create a Simple Pipeline \(AWS CodeCommit Repository\)](tutorials-simple-codecommit.md) has been updated to show how the Amazon CloudWatch Events rule and role are created when you select an AWS CodeCommit repository and branch\. [Create a Pipeline in AWS CodePipeline](pipelines-create.md) and [Edit a Pipeline in AWS CodePipeline](pipelines-edit.md) have also been updated\.  For more information, see [How to Start a Pipeline Execution in AWS CodePipeline](pipelines-about-starting.md)\.  | October 11, 2017 | 
| New and updated topics |  AWS CodePipeline now provides built\-in support for pipeline state change notifications through Amazon CloudWatch Events and Amazon Simple Notification Service \(Amazon SNS\)\. A new tutorial [Tutorial: Set Up a CloudWatch Events Rule to Receive Email Notifications for Pipeline State Changes](tutorials-cloudwatch-sns-notifications.md) has been added\. For more information, see [Detect and React to Changes in Pipeline State with Amazon CloudWatch Events](detect-state-changes-cloudwatch-events.md)\.  | September 8, 2017 | 
| New and updated topics |  You can now add AWS CodePipeline as a target for Amazon CloudWatch Events actions\. Amazon CloudWatch Events rules can be set up to detect source changes so that the pipeline starts as soon as those changes occur, or they can be set up to run scheduled pipeline executions\. Information has been added for the PollForSourceChanges source action configuration option\. For more information, see [How to Start a Pipeline Execution in AWS CodePipeline](pipelines-about-starting.md)\.  | September 5, 2017 | 
| New regions | AWS CodePipeline is now available in Asia Pacific \(Seoul\) and Asia Pacific \(Mumbai\)\. The [Limits in AWS CodePipeline](limits.md) topic and [Regions and Endpoints](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#codepipeline_region) topic have been updated\. | July 27, 2017 | 
| New regions | AWS CodePipeline is now available in US West \(N\. California\), Canada \(Central\), and EU \(London\)\. The [Limits in AWS CodePipeline](limits.md) topic and [Regions and Endpoints](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#codepipeline_region) topic have been updated\. | June 29, 2017 | 
| Updated topics | You can now view details about past executions of a pipeline, not just the most recent execution\. These details include start and end times, duration, and execution ID\. Details are available for a maximum of 100 pipeline executions during the most recent 12\-month period\. The topics [View Pipeline Details and History in AWS CodePipeline](pipelines-view.md), [AWS CodePipeline Permissions Reference](permissions-reference.md), and [Limits in AWS CodePipeline](limits.md) have been updated to reflect this support\. | June 22, 2017 | 
| Updated topic |  [Nouvola](http://www.nouvola.com/aws-codepipeline-plugin/) has been added to the list of available actions in [Test Action Integrations](integrations-action-type.md#integrations-test)\. | May 18, 2017 | 
| Updated topics | In the AWS CodePipeline wizard, the page Step 4: Beta has been renamed Step 4: Deploy\. The default name of the stage created by this step has been changed from "Beta" to "Staging"\. Numerous topics and screenshots have been updated to reflect these changes\. | April 7, 2017 | 
| Updated topics |  You can now add AWS CodeBuild as a test action to any stage of a pipeline\. This allows you to more easily use AWS CodeBuild to run unit tests against your code\. Prior to this release, you could use AWS CodeBuild to run unit tests only as part of a build action\. A build action requires a build output artifact, which unit tests typically do not produce\. The topics [Product and Service Integrations with AWS CodePipeline](integrations.md), [Edit a Pipeline in AWS CodePipeline](pipelines-edit.md), and [AWS CodePipeline Pipeline Structure Reference](reference-pipeline-structure.md) have been updated to reflect this support for AWS CodeBuild\.  | March 8, 2017 |

These credentials provide the permissions required to access AWS resources, such as putting and retrieving artifacts from Amazon S3 buckets and integrating AWS OpsWorks stacks into your pipelines\. | February 8, 2017 | 
| New region | AWS CodePipeline is now available in Asia Pacific \(Tokyo\)\. The [Limits in AWS CodePipeline](limits.md) topic and [Regions and Endpoints](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#codepipeline_region) topic have been updated\. | December 14, 2016 |

| Updated topics |  You can now add AWS CodeBuild as a build action to any stage of a pipeline\. AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed build service in the cloud that compiles your source code, runs unit tests, and produces artifacts that are ready to deploy\. You can use an existing build project or create one in the AWS CodePipeline console\. The output of the build project can then be deployed as part of a pipeline\. The topics [Product and Service Integrations with AWS CodePipeline](integrations.md), [Create a Pipeline in AWS CodePipeline](pipelines-create.md), [Authentication, Access Control, and Security Configuration for AWS CodePipeline](auth-and-access-control.md), and [AWS CodePipeline Pipeline Structure Reference](reference-pipeline-structure.md) have been updated to reflect this support for AWS CodeBuild\.
